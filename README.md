# B-tree

A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, 
insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a 
node can have more than two children.[1] Unlike self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is well suited for 
storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as discs. It is commonly used in databases 
and filesystems.
